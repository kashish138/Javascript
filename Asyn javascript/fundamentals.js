// Javascript - synchronous and single threaded
// synchronous mane ek code ke baad next code execute hoga like this
// single threaded mane ek thread pr hi hoti hai yes it is slow 

// Execution context - execute one line of code at a time
// each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

// Blocking code vs Non Blocking code
// Blocking - Block the flow of program , Read file sync
// Non blocking - Read file Async

// JS Engine is madee up of memory heap and call stack
// Web API (inside browser) - DOM acess
// task queue - add to call stack
// new api - fetch api = high priority baki same function
